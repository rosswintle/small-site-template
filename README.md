# small-site-template
A template for a small site using a simple PHP build process, TailwindCSS and AlpineJS

## NOTES

For now, it's probably best to read about this [in my blog post](https://rosswintle.uk/2022/08/why-i-love-and-how-i-make-simple-static-minimal-tech-websites/).

I WILL make a proper README soon to document this. In the meantime feel free to explore the code.

The basic things you need to know are:

1. This repo is not a library/dependence/framework. You should fork it and use it as a template for your own thing.
2. It's using HTML, TailwindCSS, and a PHP build script. AlpineJS is included if you want to use it.
3. You will need PHP installed locally. Probably v7.4 or higher. Not sure.
4. You can get up and running by running `npm install` and then `./build.sh`
